#Create a panel to draw on. 
panel = Screen()
w = 600 # width of panel
h = 600 # height of panel
panel.setup(width=w, height=h) #600 x 600 is a decent size to work on. 
#You can experiment by making it the size of your screen or super tiny!

#Don't change this line (puts (0,0) at upper left corner)
screen.setworldcoordinates(0, w, h, 0)
